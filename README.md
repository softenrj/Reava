## Firebase Configuration 🔥

To use Firebase services, you need to create a configuration file with your Firebase project credentials. 🔑

1. Create a file named `firebaseConfig.ts` inside the `Configs/` directory at the root of the project. 📂

2. Add the following Firebase initialization code to `Configs/firebaseConfig.ts` (replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials): 📝

```typescript
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import ReactNativeAsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getReactNativePersistence, initializeAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

// Initialize Firebase
export const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(ReactNativeAsyncStorage)
});
```

3. **Important:** Do not commit your Firebase credentials to version control. Keep this file secure and add it to `.gitignore` if necessary. ⚠️
